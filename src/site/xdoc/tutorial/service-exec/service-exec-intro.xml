                Rio provides a framework for the development and deployment of dynamic services.
                But what about existing technologies? Can Rio be used to deploy and manage exiting
                (external) technologies? The short answer is yes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Rio execution framework provides the ability to encapsulate the control
                and monitoring of external services. Service control adapters represent
                applications/services, adding network wide visibility and control. Using
                this approach, we can attach monitoring, metering and SLA control to
                existing applications. The illustration below shows the notional
                relationship of external services.
